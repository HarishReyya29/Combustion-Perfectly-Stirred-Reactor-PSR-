# Combustion-Perfectly-Stirred-Reactor-PSR-
This simulation assumes ideal mixing of reactants and products, providing a baseline for understanding combustion kinetics. The PSR model is used to analyze equilibrium states, ignition/extinction behavior, and sensitivity to inlet conditions.

# ⚛️ Perfectly Stirred Reactor (PSR) Simulation

This project models combustion in a PSR where complete mixing is assumed. This allows detailed analysis of reaction mechanisms and is ideal for kinetic studies.

## Objectives
- Validate chemical mechanisms under ideal mixing conditions.
- Explore ignition/extinction behavior.
- Study the evolution of major and minor species.

## Key Concepts
- Reactor kinetics
- Equilibrium analysis
- Ignition delay and flame extinction

## Tools Used
- Cantera or OpenFOAM-based PSR model
- Python for kinetic analysis

## Outcomes
- Validation of chemical reaction models
- Insight into reaction sensitivity and species trends
